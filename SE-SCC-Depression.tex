\subsection{Depression}\label{depression}

Depression is a highly common mental health condition impacting 18.4\%
of the adult US population in 2020, with impact defined as ever having
been diagnosed by a healthcare provider (\textbf{Lee2023?}). Currently,
the typical treatment for depression is a combination of psychotherapy
and medication, or just one of the two. Psychotherapy itself has been
shown to have a large impact on the reduction of depression symptom
severity and a moderate impact on self-esteem (SE) associated with
depression post-treatment (\textbf{Bhattacharya2023?}). This begins to
demonstrate the relationship between SE and depressive symptoms.
Clinically, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with
suicidal ideation (SI), explicit (conscious) SE was significantly lower
than in healthy controls and patients with MDD without SI
(\textbf{Yin2022?}). It was also demonstrated that both the size and
direction of the discrepancy in SE were significantly associated with
the severity of depressive symptoms (\textbf{Yin2022?}). These findings
demonstrated that diminished SE, meaning high implicit (unconscious) and
low explicit SE, was associated with the highest SI scores and thus
could aid in the early detection of depression and SI formation. In
general, lower SE in individuals with depressive symptoms is often
associated with SI (\textbf{Franck2007?}). These results especially make
it distinct that the discrepancy between implicit and explicit SE, more
specifically high implicit and low explicit SE, might be only shown in
currently depressed individuals with SI. Alternatively, low implicit and
low explicit SE is shown in currently depressed individuals without SI.
Although our current study employs the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D), which does not test for SI, it will be
informative to see how the differences in depressive symptoms as
measured impact the discrepancies between implicit and explicit SE.
Typically, difference score models have been used to analyze the
discrepancy between implicit and explicit SE measures;
(\textbf{Visser2024?}) used polynomial regression analysis to delve
further into these predictors of depressive symptoms. Their results
demonstrate that depression increases while explicit SE decreases;
however, depressive symptoms are almost unaffected by variations in
implicit SE (\textbf{Visser2024?}). This complicates the findings of
previous research in terms of the role of implicit SE, we hope to
resolve this convolution through the measurement of an additional
covariate. Through the use of the implicit association test (IAT),
differences in unconscious perceptions of both the self and others have
been demonstrated in people with depression. In prior research on the
self-IAT, healthy controls responded faster to both positive self and
others than negative self and others but participants with MDD did not
show this pattern (\textbf{Yao2023?}). Instead, the MDD participants
exhibited significantly smaller later-positive potential under positive
self and other schema. This suggests that depression in general leads
patients not only to negative patterns of thinking but associations in
regards to the self and others. Another form of implicit association
common to depression is that of self-depressed associations, in which
the individual associates themselves with elements of depression. Higher
self-depressed associations are a risk factor for the recurrence of MDD
and pose a potential treatment target (\textbf{Rnic2023?}). In
individuals with depression currently and remitted individuals, the
remitted individuals demonstrated a weaker automatic self-association
with depression than people currently experiencing the disorder,
however, the remitted individuals still exhibited stronger automatic
self-depressed associations than the healthy controls
(\textbf{Glashouwer2010?}). This demonstrates the importance of
identifying the covariate in SE since automatic self-association is
influential in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms.
\#\# Self-esteem and self-concept clarity Explicit SE is the deliberate
and conscious evaluation a person conducts of themselves, and can be
indicative of positive mental health when relevant to their
intrapersonal environment. In contrast, implicit SE is the often
unconscious automatic way in which a person feels about themselves.
Differentiating implicit and explicit SE is important since they have
separate underlying mechanisms and thus may have different effects on
one's SE as a whole. Two models have been proposed in how SE relates to
depression called the scar and vulnerability models of depression. The
former hypothesis is that depressive symptoms leave a scar on the
implicated individual, and the latter is that low SE contributes to
depressive symptoms (Steiger et al., 2015). Prior research, however,
demonstrated that the vulnerability model is susceptible to inaccurately
portraying causal effects due to their correlational nature
(\textbf{Sorjonen2022?}). Further, a third model called reciprocal risk,
in which SE and depressive symptoms influence each other, conflates the
generalizable results on predictors of depressive symptoms
(\textbf{Johnson2016?}). In general, findings have not been consistent
with any singular model of predicting depressive symptoms, producing
variable literature on SE. This discourse is intriguing, suggesting
there may be a covariate in the relationship between depressive systems
and SE. We are proposing self-concept clarity (SCC) as this covariate.
SCC is a structural component of the self-concept; the degree to which
self-beliefs are internally consistent, stable, and confidently defined.
Individually, SCC can mediate depression and upward social comparison
(\textbf{Butzer2006?}), and correlate with increased levels of
psychological adjustment (Bigler et al., 2001). Additionally, a low
score of SCC is independently associated with low SE (Campbell et al.,
1996). Since inconsistencies between explicit and implicit SE can be
accounted for by simultaneously evaluating self-deception as shown by
recent research (Uziel \& Cohen, 2020), SCC may represent the other end
as a mediator of SE and depressive symptoms. A disagreement in SE
distinguished by low implicit and high explicit SE may be predictive of
both low SCC as well as depressive symptoms through multivariate
modeling. This suggests that SCC may be the missing variable in the
explanation of SE differences for people with depressive symptoms. Our
aim to analyze SE discrepancy and SCC may prove to supply a target for
the treatment of depression symptoms prior to the formation of a mental
health condition.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Approval has been received from the University of Chicago Biological
Sciences Division IRB (\#24-1945). Participants will be recruited
through Prolific (Prolific.com) and will comprise of 60 US-based adults,
both male and female sex, between the ages of 18 and 65.
Over-recruitment may be needed to ensure that 60 participants complete
each of the three sessions. We will request Prolific to provide a
racially and ethnically representative sample of participants based on
U.S. census data. Participants and their respective responses will be
screened by Prolific for data quality. Prolific.com will identify and
select participants with one inclusion criteria; having provided valid
responses to previous surveys on their website. The cohort 1 wave 1
sample included 14 participants.

\subsection{Procedures \& Measures}\label{procedures-measures}

Demographic information, questionnaires, and online testing assessments
will be gathered by Prolific.com after it identifies eligible
participants. The independent factors tested will be self-concept
clarity measured by the Self-Concept Clarity Scale (Campbell et al.,
1996), implicit self-esteem measured by the Self-Esteem Implicit
Association Test (IAT) ((\textbf{Franck2007?}); Greenwald \& Farnham,
2000), and explicit self-esteem measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). The Self-Concept Clarity Scale measures
participants' self-beliefs by indicating on a Likert scale of 1 being
strongly disagreeing to 5 strongly agreeing, a series of 12 statements
such as `My beliefs about myself seem to change very frequently'. The
Self-Esteem IAT assesses self-esteem implicitly by measuring the
automatic associations of the self with negative and positive valences.
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale measures participants' self-esteem
explicitly by designating whether they agree with, on a Likert scale of
1 being strongly agree to 4 being strongly disagree, a series of 10
statements including `On a whole, I am satisfied with myself'. The
dependent factor tested will be depression symptoms as measured by the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Radloff,
1977). The CES-D evaluates the severity of depression symptoms during
the past week through a series of 20 statements rated on a Likert scale
from `rarely or none of the time' to `most or all of the time'. Both
dependent and independent variables will be measured at three time
points: baseline (time 1), one-week past baseline (time 2), and
two-weeks past baseline (time 3). Participants will receive \$12 an hour
for their participation in each wave of this study, with participants
who complete all three waves receiving a \$12 bonus. Strengths include
time efficiency in recruitment and study administration through the use
of Prolific, as well as access to a more diverse pool of participants.
Further strength is in the repeated measures, which control for
individual sources of variance in the data. Limitations of this study
are that it will be conducted remotely, therefore environmental factors
influencing participants' completion, and the quality of responses
cannot be controlled for. Additionally, the large amount of measures
included may prove to exhaust participants leading to some failing to
complete all three time points. This potential limitation is accounted
for in participant recruitment by over-recruiting. Further, there being
no eligibility criteria regarding mental health conditions and not
collecting lifetime/current mental health conditions in demographics
limits our ability to conduct a subgroup analysis regarding diagnosis.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The results suggest a significant relationship between depression and
self-esteem. There was a mean score of 15.6428571in the CES-D,
signifying moderate levels of depressive symptoms present in this
sample. In regards to a relationship between age and depressive
symptoms, a linear regression analysis was performed. This demonstrated
that age was not a significant predictor of depression symptoms
(\emph{β} = -0.1935682, \emph{p} = 0.497248). This demonstrates that age
is not significantly predictive of depressive symptoms in this sample.

This cohort measured:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Depression
\item
  Implicit Self-Esteem
\item
  Explicit Self-Esteem
\end{itemize}

Future cohorts will also measure:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Self-Concept Clarity
\end{itemize}
